# 🌐 CNN Image Classifier

An interactive and beginner-friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project built with **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras** for image classification tasks.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This project implements a simple CNN to classify images into different categories. It's designed to be easy to understand, train, and deploy!

- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Key Features:** Data preprocessing, CNN model building, training, evaluation, and predictions

---

## 🎓 Key Learning Goals
- Understand basic CNN architecture
- Train and validate a deep learning model
- Improve model performance through tuning

---

## 📚 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> _**Note**: A `requirements.txt` will list libraries like `tensorflow`, `numpy`, etc._

### 3. Run the Project
```bash
python CNN.py
```

The script will:
- Load your dataset
- Preprocess images
- Train the CNN model
- Evaluate accuracy
- Display results

## 📊 Model Architecture

Simple CNN Model with:
- **Convolutional Layers**
- **Activation Functions (ReLU)**
- **Pooling Layers**
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**
- **Softmax Output Layer**

---

## 🌈 Interactive Improvements (Optional UI Ideas)

Consider adding:
- A **Streamlit** or **Gradio** interface for real-time image upload and prediction.
- A **progress bar** for training epochs.
- **Live loss/accuracy visualization** with libraries like **Matplotlib** or **TensorBoard**.
